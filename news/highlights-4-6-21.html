              <h5><p style="color:white;">Alright. So we wanted to talk about the last 5 episodes of the podcast. They are in the "Behind the Scenes" scrapbook sorta idea if you get it.</p>

              <h4><p style="color:white;"><i>Episode 1:</i></p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">Episode 1 was the start of a podcast. The usual "A Legend Was Born" type of episode to kick it off. Although the podcast might have been distributed without an episode as per what Mr B.F.F 
              originally thought, an episode had to go up, out of the first 5, it was the shortest episode in length. The length was 2:25. It might be downhill for us but things went back up after we went through a proper setup as per 
              the last 2 articles in the <a href="/news">News Page</a>.</p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">The script was directly on the spot. Mr B.F.F had it written on a .docx file. And thought to himself, what are we going to setup if we want to challenge ourselves to make this a more tough
              podcast? (quote: he doesn't mean a stressful work to do...) So the debut of Guest Callers quickly came to action. While that happened, Frog was away and the Caller was already dialed up. Glad there's no fees for that! 
              No name of the Caller though, she's anonymous. Glad we just had a caller, Camel quoted with "Ha!" Camel asked where she lived and responded with "Colorado". Then another question with Park Meadows Mall. She responded and said: 
              "I'm close to it." Camel said the reason was her comment on the 1993 Elevator system. It was something random and Mr B.F.F added to it: Camel - "Maybe this might be deleted but who knows?". Reason behind that.... 
              Mr B.F.F didn't like the first script, as per the downfall on the first episode. The only thing good was the Interview with Robot 2 who was to be Caller #2 in Episode 2. It shows an excerpt of Robot 2 on the Mr B.F.F Projects' video he created back then. Have a good look at it.</p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">THE STORY IS OF COURSE - a parody.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

              <h4><p style="color:white;"><i>Episode 2:</i></p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">Episode 2 took a big turn around for the Podcast, as well for any minor changes to come, also for Frog making his first Debut to the podcast. Frog was up and ready and Camel is not ready to do this alone.
              Along was Robot 2 who was a friend of Robot Jr. He was in Mr B.F.F's parody which made him featured once more. So Robot 2 was invited to talk on the Camel and Frog Podcast. While we have no additional comments on Episode 2, it was a fun
              episode to film and the script was greatly executed.

              <h4><p style="color:white;"><i>Episode 3:</i></p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">Episode 3 took another fall as ratings lagged and were mixed for not making original words in the script and using quotes. While the episode lacked creativity, Mr B.F.F needed to step it up a little for the next episodes.
              Yet Mr B.F.F claims it was still original when he got to work on the script. Angelo even went to comment. "Although it wasn't what we looked for when I took the deal with Mr B.F.F, he is the one to still be on the good for creating great ideas and producing 
              the communication for us and the team in the podcast. He really did help us build the podcast to drive. Or I'll flydrive...."</p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">Also viewers called out on what Camel Tribute was there to be, until the next episode, ratings went slightly up. They were satisfied.</p>

              <h4><p style="color:white;"><i>Episode 4:</i></p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">Episode 4 was the greatest in Length so far out of the first 5 episodes, ratings slightly up! Which had Mr B.F.F on the run! The episode contain Frog 2 with Double voices from Frog and Frog 2 which is somewhat hard to compare. It also 
              revealed the next guest caller for Episode 5. Although there were minor flaws, this is one of the best of the Mr B.F.F episodes that were created, but however Mr B.F.F got too stressed on the episode so he had a friend as well as Angelo to assist. After that, Mr B.F.F 
              left to move on other projects and his YouTube channel. He might have not liked the script his friend made so he modified it so it's safe for work and all jokes are not taken seriously. </p>

              <h4><p style="color:white;">READ STORY: <i><a href="/news/angelo-jackson-takes-over-camelandfroglivepodcast">Angelo takes over Camel and Frog Podcast!</a></i></h4>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">We have no other additional comments including the "Kid" mentioned. Mr B.F.F's friend watches a lot of "Anime", let's just say that, no take-down on that.

              <h4><p style="color:white;"><i>Episode 5:</i></p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">And finally, episode 5 where we explore the internet with Caller #5, Butterfly who will be back on Episode 8, the very latest, stay tuned.. We looked at one meme called the "BITS", we immediately laughed at looking at it for some reason. 
              It also took a dive on the voice used in the Podcast as well. It was something that was enjoyable to make and listen too as well as including Butterfly's story. The ratings were balanced. One more work to add on this. OK....</p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">We wanted to share this for the next episode and talk about our thoughts on this too..... oof.</p>

              <h4><p style="color:white;"><i>Conclusion:</i></p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">While Camel said, <i>"there is real life stuff that is stopping us from making another episode...</i>, The crew definitely agreed on the matter and is looking to push harder on the podcast. The goal is to have one episode per month while making stories
              on this website more often. Angelo will be ready for the long ride. Stay tuned! Episode 8 is coming. We soon compile the next 5 episodes when the last parts of episodes 9 & 10 get released as well. Take care everybody.</p>
